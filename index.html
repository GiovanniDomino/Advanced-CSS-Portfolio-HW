      <p class="lead font text-white">Hello! My name is Giovanni Domino and I am 20 years old. I have been working on my skills as a full-stack developer to be able to work in a creative environment. As of now I am able to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. </p>
      <hr class="my-2">
      <p class="text-white">With these skills I am able to create websites like this from scratch and apply what I want my website to do. With HTML I am able to start the base of the website, and with CSS, I'm able to customize the website to however I want it to look. However I am still learning on how to use JavaScript and I am not using it on this website.</p>
      <p class="text-white">I am willing to learn more about how to expand my skills and chase new career paths using this knowledge.</p>
